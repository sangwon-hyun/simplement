#+title: simplement: helper functions for simulations and numerical experiments


This directory contains code that directly generates a software package called
~simplement~, using [[https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project][litr]]. Each R Markdown document in this directory -- called
~1description.Rmd~, ~2helpers-data.Rmd~, and so forth -- contain code that
directly builds the R package.

The resulting "knitted" documentation from these files is [[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sangwon-hyun/flowtrend/blob/main/_book/index.html][here]], and..

The resulting R package is in the subdirectory [[./simplement]], and can be
installed as follows.

#+begin_src R
remotes::install_github("sangwon-hyun/simplement", subdir = "simplement")
#+end_src

The repository is currently private.
